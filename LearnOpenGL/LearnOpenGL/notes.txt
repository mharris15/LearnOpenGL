The processing cores run small programs on the GPU for each step of the
pipeline. These small programs are called shaders.

Shaders are written in the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).

A fragment in OpenGL is all the data required for OpenGL to render a single pixel.

The main purpose of the fragment shader is to calculate the final color of a pixel and this is
usually the stage where all the advanced OpenGL effects occur.
Usually the fragment shader contains
data about the 3D scene that it can use to calculate the final pixel color (like lights, shadows, color
of the light and so on).

VBO: vertex buffer object
VAO: vertex array object
EBO: element buffer objects
